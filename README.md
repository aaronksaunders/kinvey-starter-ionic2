#### Checkout the repo and run `npm install` to download the required node modules for the project

#### Required Plugins
* Camera
* File

### Create Account w/ Kinvey
* We are using the Javascript API in this project not the angular module
* When I upgraded to Ionic2 and the Kinvey JS API I did leave the original REST API code in the project if you are looking for that solution also

### Setup
Edit the configuration file, [`src/providers/config.ts`](https://github.com/aaronksaunders/kinvey-starter-ionic2/blob/master/src/providers/config.ts) to contain the proper credentials from your kinvey account

```Javascript
export let KINVEY_BASE_URL = "https://baas.kinvey.com/";
export let appKey = "YOUR-APP-KEY-GOES-HERE"
export let secretKey = "YOUR-SECRET-KEY-GOES-HERE"
export let KINVEY_AUTH = btoa(appKey + ':' + secretKey)
```

Make sure in your kinvey console to create a collect named `todo-collection` and the object is structured like this
```Javascript
{
  description: "Sample To Do Description"
  title: "Sample To Do"
  status: "open"
}
```

**The application demonstrates the following:**
* Login and Logout
* Create New User Account
* View Data Collection
* Delete Object From Data Collection - *swipe list item to expose delete button* (In Progress)
* Add Object to Data Collection
* Using Camera Plugin to capture image and then upload file
* Add File Objects as A Collection
